# Tools Needed

Before we go into what Koding Apps are and how to create them, lets go over
required and/or useful knowledge and tools. Don't forget to checkout the
[Useful Tools][useful tools] page after you get through Getting Started.

## Services

### Github
The Koding App infrastructure utilizes [Github](http://github.com) for storing app
specific resources (js, images, css, scripts). This enables developers to store
there apps for free without worry, making the Koding app workflow simple.

## Languages

### CoffeeScript or JavaScript

Koding Applications are primarily programmed in [CoffeeScript][coffeescript].
While you can technically use any language, as long as the final output is a
single javascript file named `index.js` within the root of your App directory.

## Tools

### KDC, The Koding Compiler

The [Koding Compiler][kdc], otherwise known as `kdc` is a small utility to
compile Koding apps to a single `index.js` file.

This tool comes with your Koding VM, you do not need to install it.

### DevTools

[DevTools][devtools] is an application designed to help you develop your app.
It is also used to publish your app. It also comes preinstalled.
