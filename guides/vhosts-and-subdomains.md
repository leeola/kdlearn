# Koding Subdomains and VHosts

In this guide we'll go over setting up a Koding subdomain to point to a 
directory of your choice.

## Creating Subdomains

To create a subdomain, refer to the [Subdomain Section 
here](/faq/vm-hostname/)

## Creating a Virtual Host

First, run the following command, where `mysubdomain` is the name of your subdomain.

```text
sudo touch /etc/apache2/sites-available/mysubdomain.conf
```

Next, open the above file with `nano`, `vim`, or whatever command line 
editor you prefer. We're using a command line editor, because files 
located in `/etc/apache2/sites-available` are owned by `root`, and 
require sudo.

If you used nano, your command should look like this:

```text
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/mysubdomain.conf
```

Now that you have the file open with your preferred editor, paste in the 
following code:

```xml
<Virtualhost *:80>
  ServerName mysubdomain.username.koding.io
  DocumentRoot /var/www/myDirectory
</Virtualhost>
```

There are a two things you're going to have to change here, so lets go over them.

- **ServerName**: The value of `ServerName` should be your full subdomain 
  url, without the http.

- **DocumentRoot**: This is the folder location that you want the 
  subdomain to direct to. Remember that `/var/www` equals `~/Web`, so in 
the given example, `/var/www/myDirectory` equals `~/Web/myDirectory`.  

```xml
<Virtualhost *:80>
  ServerName hello.joshmurray.koding.io
  DocumentRoot /var/www/helloworld
</Virtualhost>
```

**Note:** The DocumentRoot has to be an absolute path. Relative 
directories such as `/var/www/../foo` and `~/MyDirectory` will not work.  
If you would like to supply an directory *outside* of `~/Web`, use your 
full home path, eg: `/home/joshmurray/myNotWebDirectory`

## Enable the Subdomain

Lastly, we need to add our "site" and reload apache. Run the following 
two commands, replacing `mysubdomain` with the name of your subdomain.

```text
sudo a2ensite mysubdomain
sudo service apache2 reload
```

## Confirming

To confirm you did all the steps completely, connect to 
`http://mysubdomain.username.koding.io` and you should see whatever you 
have in your directory of choice. 

## Troubleshooting

### Apache 404

If you see a plain white page saying **"Not Found"** with mentions of 
Apache and Ubuntu, then Apache is correctly loading a directory, but the 
directory is empty. Confirm that your `DocumentRoot` is a correct, and an 
**absolute** directory.

### Forbidden

By default, Apache is configured to not allow access to directories 
outside of `/var/www`. So, if you link to an absolute directory outside 
of `/var/www`, such as `/home/joshmurray/hello`, you may see a message 
similar to the following.

```
You do not have permission to access / on this server.
```

To resolve this, you can use the `<Directory>` directive inside of your 
`VirtualHost` directive from above. Example:

```xml
<Virtualhost *:80>
  ServerName hello.joshmurray.koding.io
  DocumentRoot /home/joshmurray/hello
  <Directory /home/joshmurray/hello/>
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride None
    Require all granted
  </Directory>
</Virtualhost>
```

Afterwards, don't forget to reload Apache, with the following command.

```text
sudo service apache2 reload
```

**Important**: It is recommended that you review the [Directory directive 
documentation](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/core.html#directory), 
as there are security implications to allowing directory access, that you 
should understand.

### I don't have a Subdomain

If you do not already have a Subdomain, you need to create one with the 
same name that you used in your [Virtual Host 
configuration](#creating-a-virtual-host).

To do this, from Koding navigate to your IDE window and go to your VM 
Settings. This will appear as little circle next to your VM Name in the 
left sidebar of Koding. From the settings menu, Click "More", and add any 
subdomains that you need.

For a more indepth explanation of this process, refer to the [Subdomain 
Section here](/faq/vm-hostname/).
