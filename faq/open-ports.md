importance: 5

Most Unix ports are available on Koding VMs. We do not block any TCP traffic
(inbound or outbound). See the following list for open ports, as well as ports in use by default.

- Ports **2** through **65,534** are open.
- Port **80** is taken by Apache, but this can be turned off to free up the port. To turn
  off Apache, type in: `sudo service apache2 stop` in Terminal.
- Ports **2** through **1,024** require `sudo` access.
