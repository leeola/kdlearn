In short no. Why...? It's because when you first create your account we provision a lot of support services in the background for your account and all of these would need to get updated. This becomes problematic if you have made changes to your VM (even if you have created one file). If you really want to change your username, the only option is to delete your current account and make a new one with the desired username.

But ... you can however , change your display name as seen associated with your the bulletin board posts. Just browse to https://koding.com/Account/Profile where you may change "Name" and/or "LastName" as you would like them to appear to other koding users wherever you chat on koding. This quite niftily has the side-effect of changing your nick on all of you past postings instantaneously. Note that this feature does not in any way allow you to be anonymous. Anyone who clicks on your chat nick (whatever it may be at the time) will always see your canonical username in the URL of your profile.

So to be clear , you may change your display name at any time but this does not affect your login username or VM URL. As stated above that is your system UID and can not be changed.
