# TogetherJS Setup and Usage for Beginners

In this article we will go over beginner steps for TogetherJS.

## What is TogetherJS?

TogetherJS is a drop-in collaboration framework. Think of it like easily adding Google Docs to any site. Normally when you program a real time site, you use a framework like SocketIO, SockJS, or Firebase, and it takes a considerable amount of work just to make content sync up between clients. Adding text chat/mouse tracking/voice chat is a lot of additional work that is often outside the scope of your project. TogetherJS takes away that problem. You focus on your application, and TogetherJS can focus on the difficulty of mouse tracking. With just two lines of code, you get all of these features. Easy! 

## Setting up TogetherJS

In the following example, we'll setup TogetherJS by using a plain html page and the TogetherJS Scripts. 

And just like that, we have a static page with text chat, voice chat, and mouse tracking built into our html page! And because we used [Koding](https://koding.com) we can share this project with our friends easily. On localhost you would have to run a web server, expose and forward your ports, figure out your ip, and finally share it with a friend. Koding saves you that localhost-hassle, and makes this a one-step process. Just share your domain and you're done.
