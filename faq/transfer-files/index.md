### I want to copy a few files
Getting a few files to your Koding VM is simple and there are a variety of methods. We've put together a short video titled [Importing your files](/videos) in the Video's section of Koding University. Check that out for a simple drag-drop method to upload a few files.

### I want to copy or download a large number of files
To copy several files, we prepared a number of guides that can help you. Head over to our [file transfer category](/categories/file-transfer) and choose one of the methods that you think best suits your needs.

### I want to download my files
If you want an easier way to download your files follow this steps:

Select multiple files in the IDE (you can use CTRL/CMD + left click) and then click on the little arrow.

After that select the Compress option and the type of archive you want to create.

The last step you need to do it to place the archive into the Web folder and then just access the a similar URL:

```
http://KODING_USERNAME.koding.io/<path/name of the archive>
```
