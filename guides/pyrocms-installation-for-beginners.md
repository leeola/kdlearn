# PyroCMS Setup and Installation for Beginners

This article will cover the basic steps on how to setup a blog using PyroCMS as the base.

## What's PyroCMS?

Good question. It's a really simple, flexible and community driven CMS built with the CodeIgniter PHP framework that has an on-growing community of developers and supporters around it.

But how do you set up PyroCMS on [Koding](https://koding.com)? Well it's simple, you just follow the simple tutorial below step by step. After you've finished with the tutorial you'll have a brand new website that runs PyroCMS.

## Step-by-step PyroCMS

### Step 1.

Open up your [Koding](https://koding.com) Terminal and type in the following command to get you started. [code]cd Web;[/code]

### Step 2.

Still in the terminal window download the source code like so: [code]wget https://www.pyrocms.com/downloads/v2.2.3[/code] or whatever the latest version you can find on the official website.

### Step 3.

We rename the downloaded file, unzip it and rename the newly created folder. [code] mv v2.2.3 v2.2.3.zip; unzip v2.2.3.zip; mv pyrocms-pyrocms-08759da pyrocms [/code]

### Step 4.

We now can navigate to our newly created folder. We open up a new browser 
window and type in 
[code]http://[your-vm-hostname].[your-Koding-username].koding.io/pyrocms[/code] 
then just follow the steps that show up on the screen to install it.

Alright then, that was fun. You now have a brand new website that runs PyroCMS.
