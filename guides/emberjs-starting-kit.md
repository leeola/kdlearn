# EmberJS: A Starting Kit for Beginners

Ambitious applications are the future. The way we interact with a web application will impact our productivity. That's why in this short tutorial we are going to cover some of the basics of [EmberJS](http://emberjs.com).

## EmberJS: The facts

They say that if you use EmberJS you don't have to reinvent the wheel. Well we say that they are right. EmberJS is built for developers by developers. It's friendly, fast and definitely a good alternative if you want to build something awesome. And we here at Koding like it when people build awesome stuff, therefor this tutorial is here to help you get started with one of the most on-growing and well-built frameworks out there. Right, now let's get started on how to set up EmberJS on [Koding](https://koding.com). 

## The Steps

### Step 1.

We open up a new file using your favorite code editor inside [Koding](https://koding.com), because as you may know, you have Ace pre-installed or maybe you're a Vim or Emacs individual. For the sake of this tutorial we are going to use the Ace editor. 

### Step 2.

We copy and paste the following code into are newly created file.

```
<!doctype html> <html> <head> <meta charset=utf-8 /> <title>Ember Koding 
Demo</title> </head> <body> <script type="text/x-handlebars" 
data-template-name="index"> <h2>Ember.js on Koding</h2> <ul> {{#each item 
in model}} <li>{{item}}</li> {{/each}} </ul> </script> <script 
src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js"></script> 
<script 
src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/handlebars.js/1.1.2/handlebars.min.js"></script> 
<script 
src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/ember.js/1.1.2/ember.min.js"></script> 
<script> App = Ember.Application.create({}); App.IndexRoute = 
Ember.Route.extend({ setupController: function(controller) { 
controller.set('content', ['cyan', 'magenta', 'penguin', 'pie']); } }); 
</script> </body> </html>
```
 Ok now that we saved the file and opened up the preview and saw that 
everything worked as it should let's explain a bit what is actually 
happening. First, before everything, we need the following libraries that 
make our EmberJS app work: jQuery, handlebars and of course emberJS. The 
app uses handlebars for templating.  After we set up the template and 
loaded the libraries we need to create the actual app. First we 
initialize ember and then we use a Router that helps to manage the state 
of the application and the resources needed as a user navigates the app.  
In our case set some content using the already created template that was 
made possible with the help of the handlebars library. And there you have 
it. A short tutorial on how to use EmberJS on
