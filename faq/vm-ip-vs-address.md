title: Should I use my VM's IP or Address?
importance: 4

Koding gives you access to your VMs IP, as well as an Address that 
always points to that VM's IP, so which should you use, and why?

While your VMs IP will operate perfectly fine, the IP is dynamic. In 
other words, it will change. Because of this, Koding gives you a [VM
Address][vm address], which will *always* point to your VM, regardless of 
IP changes, so this is what you usually want to use.

Note: IP addresses of "Always On" VMs don't change until they are rebooted.

If you have trouble finding your VM Address, [click here][vm address].
