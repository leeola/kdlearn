# Creating KDApps

In this guide series we'll go over the basics of what KDApps are, from a 
developer perspective, and how to create them. We'll touch briefly on the 
KDFramework source, but mostly we'll be linking back to the source for method 
and API references. Lets get started!

## What is a Koding App (KDApp)?

Koding Apps are created using the Koding Framework (KDFramework) and live
on the [Koding App Store](https://koding.com/Apps). Koding users 
install KDApps based on interest. It is entirely user driven.

KDApps come in a variety of flavors. On the App store you will find apps
in the games, installers, stacks and several other categories.
