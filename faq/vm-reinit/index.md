Sometimes, after you're installed a slew of software and things have started to conflict,
there's a need to send your VM back to it's original state. To achieve that, Koding offers
an easy reinitialization function which you can use at any time you like. 

#### What does reinitialization do?
When you reinit your VM, the system will delete everything on your VM and create a new one from
scratch. **NOTE: You will lose all existing data (unless you back it up somewhere) on the VM
that you are reinitializing. This is an irreversible process so please proceed with caution.** To backup
your data, we recommend you [use FTP](http://learn.koding.com/guides/setting-up-ftp-on-koding/) 
to transfer the files.

Reinitialization will however preserve your VM settings and any domain names that you may have created.

#### How do I reinit my VM?
To reinit your VM, follow these easy steps:
1. turn your VM to "on" state
2. head over to the VM settings panel (as shown in the screen shot below)
3. expand the "More" and "Advanced" sections
4. click the "Reinitialize" button inside the Advanced section.

Once you initiate a reinit, you will see appropriate messages on the screen as your VM rebuilds.
