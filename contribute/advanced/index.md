# Advanced

In this guide we'll go over contributing by using Git directly in your 
Terminal, and editing our documents on Koding. While we will go over 
every step, general Git and Terminal knowledge will be very helpful, and 
are recommended. So, lets get started!

## Forking and Cloning

First up, we should cover the requirements.

1. A [Koding][kodingreg] Account
2. A [Github][github] Account
3. Git *(Comes with your Koding VM)*
4. SSH Key on Github. If you're not familiar with this, refer to [this 
tutorial][githubssh]

Next, we need to "Fork" the [KDLearn Repo][repo]. This will create your 
own version of the repo on Github, and lets you push your changes to this 
repo.

To do this, press the Fork button seen in the following image, from the 
[KDLearn repo][repo] page:

![fork](fork.png)

This will create a new Github repository with the name 
`github.com/yourUsername/kdlearn`. The purpose of this forked repository 
will become clear once we make our Pull Request.

Next, we will want to clone our newly forked repository. Head on over to 
your [Koding Terminal][terminal] and type in the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourUsername/kdlearn.git
```

This will clone your Forked Repository to your Koding VM, into the folder 
`kdlearn`.

## Writing a new Guide

Now that we have our repo cloned, lets add our guide. Open up the [Ace 
editor][ace] and open a folder titled `kdlearn`. In this section we're 
going to write a guide, but if you just want to edit another guide, 
scroll down to the [edit](#editing-a-guide) section.

Lets create a file in the **guides** folder with the name `myguide.md`.  
Name the file whatever you like, just try to keep it short and url 
friendly.

This is where we will write all of our content, in Markdown. For this 
tutorial i am just going to use the following text:

```markdown
# Awesome Guide

This is my **awesome** guide! Follow along, and learn to be awesome!

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Suspendisse dui 
nulla, posuere non urna in, lobortis malesuada erat. Morbi ultricies 
fringilla condimentum. Aliquam vel sodales mi, ornare ullamcorper est.  
Nulla laoreet dapibus libero, in consectetur dolor fermentum vel. Etiam 
quis magna eget orci fringilla tincidunt et non justo. Phasellus porta 
dictum libero. Suspendisse fringilla gravida arcu, eu venenatis nunc 
fermentum sed. Phasellus est libero, auctor ac dignissim ac, consequat a 
libero. Pellentesque iaculis sem tortor.  Suspendisse viverra, arcu ac 
viverra dapibus, massa odio adipiscing neque, eget adipiscing magna quam 
id dui. Morbi semper nisi ac accumsan tincidunt.
```

Now that we have written our guide, we need to add some metadata to it.



## Metadata

Metadata is, as the name says, data about our data. This is where you can 
specify the title of your document, the author, the date, and categories.  
Lets take a look at our above markdown with some of this metadata.

# Awesome Guide

This is my **awesome** guide! Follow along, and learn to be awesome!

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Suspendisse dui nulla, 
posuere non urna in, lobortis malesuada erat. Morbi ultricies fringilla 
condimentum. Aliquam vel sodales mi, ornare ullamcorper est. Nulla laoreet 
dapibus libero, in consectetur dolor fermentum vel. Etiam quis magna eget orci 
fringilla tincidunt et non justo. Phasellus porta dictum libero. Suspendisse 
fringilla gravida arcu, eu venenatis nunc fermentum sed. Phasellus est libero, 
auctor ac dignissim ac, consequat a libero. Pellentesque iaculis sem tortor.  
Suspendisse viverra, arcu ac viverra dapibus, massa odio adipiscing neque, eget 
adipiscing magna quam id dui. Morbi semper nisi ac accumsan tincidunt.
```

Most of that is pretty logical. The `---` before and after signifies the 
metadata start and end, and `author`, `date`, `description`, and `categories` 
should be standard nomenclature to you.



## Editing a Guide

If you're just looking to update a guide, fix typos, or make general 
improvements you have it even easier.

Just like before, open up [Ace][ace] and find the file you want to edit.  
If you're not sure where the proper markdown is located, find the url of 
the page you want to edit and think of them like folders. Then, review 
the [File Structre](#file-structure) section and you should have a pretty 
good idea where the files are located.

Make your edits, and follow onto the next section!



## Adding, Committing, Pushing

Now that we have made our changes, whether it's a new guide or an edited 
guide, we need to add the file, commit it, and push it to our repo. Open 
up the [Terminal][terminal] one last time.

To add your changes, run the following command. Replacing `myguide` with 
the files you changed.

```
git add guides/myguide.md
```


To commit your changes, run the following command. Replacing `I added an 
awesome guide` with a message that clearly describes your changes.

```
git commit -m "I added an awesome guide"
```

You can also ommit the whole `-m "message"` flag and use an editor such 
as Nano or Vim to make your changes. But the above is simpler for this 
guide.

And finally, lets push our changes to our repo on Github.

```
git push origin master
```

If you're not familiar with Git at all, run each of these commands in 
sequence.  We won't be covering Git in full, so for more information 
please see the official documentation.


## Making a Pull Request

Now that you pushed to Github you can visit your forked Github repository 
and make a pull request. To do this, look for the "Pull Request" button 
on your forked repo:

![pull request](pull-request.png)

This will take you to a page where you can review all of the commits you 
made, and ensure that you want to make a pull request. Please review your 
changes for typos, spelling, and grammar.

If you spot an issue, and need to make more changes, go back to 
[Koding][ace] and make the edits you need. Make sure to add, commit, and 
push them just like before.

If you're happy with your changes, press the big green **Create Pull 
Request** button.



## Waiting for your PR to be Accepted

Once your PR is made, you're done! The Koding Team will review your edits 
or new guides and make feedback.

If we need you to make corrections, formatting or otherwise, go through 
the same steps as before. Your changes, once pushed to Github, will 
automatically be reflected in your Pull Request.

Once they are accepted, and your pull request is merged, the site will be 
updated and you're changes will be live. Thanks for your contribution!

In the next guide we'll go over previewing your work in a local 
installation of Koding University.
