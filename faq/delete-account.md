You do not have to contact Koding support if you wish to delete your account. Simply head over to [Account Settings](https://koding.com/Account/Delete) from where you can easily initiate the deletion process.

It would help us immensly if you can take the quick 3 question survey right after the deletion process ends. It will help us understand why we lost you and how we can improve.
